##Introduction
Human bodies are genetically able to maintain their position/orientation relative to the Earth through spatial orientation. 
The inner ear contains the vestibular system which is sometimes referred to as the equilibrium organ as it is responsible for this.
This is easily done in the human body on ground, however, in flight this becomes difficult. 
This is known as Spatial Disorientation (SD) and is a consequence of aviation. About 5 to 10% of aviation accidents are due to this where 90% are fatal. 

##Scope of the Project 
To compare data and SD crash aspects across domains we will utilize Bayesian Machine Learning Models (MLM). This will help us to understand conditional probabilities of relevant factors.
Bayes Theorem is used for calculating conditional probabilities. We can use this along with previous accident reports and analyze the weather conditions, location and geographical
conditions, the pilot, and their training, and mechanical failures, etc.
